My creative web feature will be a multi-listing management software for individuals. The primary platforms will be eBay and Facebook Marketplace, to track managed goods.
The Technology stack I will use is MERN - MongoDB for the Database, Express Server, React Front-end and Node backend
External API calls will be made to each platform to publish the listings and delist them, OAuth verification. Within my own Database, I will hold user detail information as well as listing information which will be used to automate the process
The focus Audience for the service is specifically individuals who resell on the platforms previously mentioned, selling goods such as clothes, electronics or collectables. Furthermore my site aims to extend individuals reach, save them time and make managing multiple listings on several sites simpler and more automated.
